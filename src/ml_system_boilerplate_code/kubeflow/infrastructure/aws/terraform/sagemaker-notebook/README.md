# Sagemaker Notebook

Provides an always on SageMaker Notebook instance that can speak to our internal MetaData Service and Datastore.
This will allow data scientists to use this notebook as a way to interact with historical flows, inspecting executions and artifacts.

Depends on the output of the `infra` and `metaflow` projects.
