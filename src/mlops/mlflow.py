"""
The script defines a train_and_log_model function that takes in the training data and a machine learning model as input. It starts an MLflow run, 
logs the model and its hyperparameters using mlflow.sklearn.log_model, logs the training data using mlflow.log_artifact, 
logs the environment variables using mlflow.log_param and logs the accuracy of the model using mlflow.log_metric.

You can extend this script to include more functionality as per your requirement like logging other metrics like precision, 
recall or f1-score, logging model performance on test dataset, and more complex monitoring, versioning, and deployment functionality.

It's important to note that mlflow is a powerful tool that allows you to track and manage your machine learning experiments 
and models, but if you are looking for a more complete solution for MLOps, you might want to consider using other tools such as Kubeflow, 
MLFlow or TensorFlow Extended (TFX) which provide more advanced functionality to manage machine learning models throughout the entire ML lifecycle.
