# GPT FROM SCRATCH
This tutorial is for educational purposes only, and closely follows the youtube video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY 

as well a the NanoGPT at the repo: 
https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT

The data used in this tutorial is the tiny-shakespeare data, found here: 
https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn/blob/master/data/tiny-shakespeare.txt
(raw: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn/master/data/tiny-shakespeare.txt).
However, as mentioned in Andrej's youtube video, you can use any arbitrary text dataset that you'd like. 

This is in no way my original work, I am simply using this directory as an exercise in understanding the transformer architecture with generative modeling on top. Nothing more. 

If you have any questions, please refer to the youtube video listed above :).
