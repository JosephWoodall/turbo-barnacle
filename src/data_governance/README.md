# Data Governance

## Introduction
- Data Governance refers to the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data used in an organization. It involves establishing policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines to ensure that data is of high quality and protected against unauthorized access or misuse.  

- The primary objectives of data governance are to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data, to increase efficiency and reliability in data-related activities, to reduce the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access, and to support decision-making by providing access to trusted data.  

- Data Governance can encompass a wide range of activities, including data management, data quality, data security, metadata management, and business intelligence. It involves the collaboration of different departments and stakeholders within an organization, such as IT, legal, compliance, and business units, to ensure that data is managed in a manner that meets the needs of the organization.  

- Overall, effective data governance can help organizations to maximize the value of their data assets, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, and support informed decision-making.

### Discovery and Design 
- The discovery and design phase of Data Governance is the first step in establishing a Data Governance program. During this phase, organizations gather information about their existing data systems, processes, and stakeholders to determine their current state and identify areas for improvement.

- The primary activities of the discovery and design phase include:

    - Assessment: During this step, organizations conduct a thorough analysis of their data systems, processes, and stakeholders to understand the current state of their data and identify any existing pain points or challenges.

    - Stakeholder identification: Organizations identify the key stakeholders who will be involved in the Data Governance program and determine their roles and responsibilities.

    - Business requirements gathering: Organizations gather requirements from business units to understand the specific data needs and ensure that the Data Governance program supports their objectives.

    - Data inventory: Organizations create a comprehensive inventory of their data assets, including data sources, types, and formats, to understand the scope of their data and identify areas for improvement.

    - Data quality assessment: Organizations assess the quality of their data to identify any issues, such as duplicates, inaccuracies, or incompleteness, and determine the impact on business processes.

    - Process definition: Organizations define the processes and procedures for Data Governance, including data management, data quality, data security, and metadata management.

- The outcome of the discovery and design phase is a detailed plan for the Data Governance program that includes a clear understanding of the current state of the data, the business requirements, the processes and procedures, and the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders. This plan provides a foundation for the development and implementation of the Data Governance program.

### Capture and Curate
- The Capture and Curate phase of Data Governance focuses on the ongoing management of data within an organization. The goal of this phase is to ensure that data is captured and managed in a manner that supports the goals of the Data Governance program.

- The primary activities of the Capture and Curate phase include:

    - Data collection and ingestion: Organizations collect data from various sources and systems and ingest it into a centralized data repository, such as a data lake or a data warehouse.

    - Data cataloging: Organizations create a catalog of their data assets, including information about the data, its origin, its format, and its relationship to other data assets.

    - Data quality management: Organizations monitor and manage the quality of their data to ensure its accuracy, completeness, and consistency. This may involve data cleansing, data enrichment, and data standardization.

    - Data stewardship: Organizations assign data stewards to oversee the management of specific data assets and ensure that data is properly managed and governed.

    - Metadata management: Organizations manage metadata, including data definitions, relationships, and lineage information, to support data discovery and understanding.

- The outcome of the Capture and Curate phase is a centralized and well-managed data repository that supports the goals of the Data Governance program. By capturing and curating data in a consistent and controlled manner, organizations can ensure the quality, security, and accessibility of their data assets. This in turn supports informed decision-making and enables organizations to extract maximum value from their data.

### Consume
- The Consume phase of Data Governance focuses on the use and dissemination of data within an organization. The goal of this phase is to ensure that data is consumed in a manner that supports the goals of the Data Governance program.

- The primary activities of the Consume phase include:

    - Data access and distribution: Organizations determine who has access to their data and how it is distributed to different stakeholders. This may involve defining data access policies and procedures, setting up data sharing agreements, and implementing data access controls.

    - Data visualization and reporting: Organizations use data visualization and reporting tools to support informed decision-making and communicate data insights.

    - Data analytics: Organizations use data analytics to uncover insights, support business decisions, and improve performance.

    - Data usage monitoring: Organizations monitor the usage of their data to ensure that it is being used in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Data Governance program.

    - Data privacy and security: Organizations ensure the privacy and security of their data by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as data encryption and access controls.

- The outcome of the Consume phase is a data-driven organization that uses data to support informed decision-making, improve performance, and achieve its business objectives. By consuming data in a secure and controlled manner, organizations can ensure the confidentiality, privacy, and security of their data assets and achieve the full potential of their Data Governance program.

### Share and Use
- The Share and Use phase of Data Governance focuses on the exchange and sharing of data between organizations. The goal of this phase is to ensure that data is shared in a manner that supports the goals of the Data Governance program.

- The primary activities of the Share and Use phase include:

    - Data exchange agreements: Organizations establish data exchange agreements with other organizations to determine the terms and conditions for sharing data.

    - Data integration: Organizations integrate data from multiple sources, including data from other organizations, to support business processes and decision-making.

    - Data exchange: Organizations exchange data with other organizations in accordance with the data exchange agreements.

    - Data privacy and security: Organizations ensure the privacy and security of the data being shared by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as data encryption and access controls.

- The outcome of the Share and Use phase is an organization that is able to effectively share and exchange data with other organizations to support its business objectives. By sharing data in a secure and controlled manner, organizations can achieve the full potential of their Data Governance program and unlock the value of data.

### Overall Operating Processes
- The overall operating process of Data Governance can be broken down into several key phases:

    - Discovery and Design: During this phase, organizations assess their current data landscape and design a Data Governance program that aligns with their business objectives and requirements. This phase may involve defining the scope of the program, establishing data governance policies and procedures, and identifying key stakeholders.

    - Capture and Curate: During this phase, organizations focus on the ongoing management of data within the organization. This phase involves collecting data from various sources and systems, creating a catalog of data assets, managing data quality, and assigning data stewards.

    - Consume: During this phase, organizations focus on the use and dissemination of data within the organization. This phase involves determining who has access to data, using data visualization and reporting tools, and monitoring data usage.

    - Share and Use: During this phase, organizations focus on the exchange and sharing of data between organizations. This phase involves establishing data exchange agreements, integrating data from multiple sources, and exchanging data with other organizations.

    - Monitor and Evaluate: During this phase, organizations monitor and evaluate the Data Governance program to ensure its ongoing effectiveness and alignment with business objectives. This phase may involve conducting regular audits, assessing data quality, and making updates to the program as needed.

- The operating process of Data Governance is an ongoing cycle of discovery, design, implementation, and evaluation. By continuously monitoring and improving the program, organizations can ensure that their data assets are effectively managed and governed to support their business objectives.
