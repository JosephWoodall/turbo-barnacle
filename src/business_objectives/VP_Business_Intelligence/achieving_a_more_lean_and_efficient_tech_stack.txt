As a VP of Business Intelligence, there are several best practices you can follow to achieve a more lean and efficient technology stack. Here are some general tips:

    1. Evaluate the current technology stack: Start by evaluating the current technology stack and identifying any areas of redundancy or inefficiency. This can involve reviewing the systems and tools being used, as well as the data sources and processes being employed.

    2. Prioritize key functionality: Identify the key functionality required to support the business intelligence needs of the organization, and focus on selecting and implementing tools that support those requirements. This can help to reduce the complexity of the technology stack and increase efficiency.

    3. Choose scalable solutions: Look for solutions that are scalable and can grow with the organization. This can help to avoid the need for frequent technology stack overhauls, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

    4. Leverage cloud-based solutions: Consider cloud-based solutions, which can be more flexible and cost-effective than traditional on-premises solutions. Cloud-based solutions can also offer greater scalability and easier integration with other systems.

    5. Standardize tools and processes: Standardize on a set of tools and processes that are widely used across the organization. This can help to reduce training requirements and ensure that everyone is using the same tools and methodologies.

Here's an example of a lean and efficient technology stack for a business intelligence department:

    - Cloud-based data storage and management platform, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

    - Data integration and transformation tool, such as Talend or Apache NiFi.

    - Data visualization and reporting tool, such as Tableau or Power BI.

    - Machine learning and predictive analytics tools, such as Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow.

    - Collaborative project management and communication tools, such as Asana or Trello.

Step-by-Step Example on how to plan and meet all of the best practices to follow to achieve a more lean and efficient technology stack: 
    1.Evaluate the existing technology stack:
        - Identify all of the tools, applications, and systems currently in use within the business intelligence department.
        - Assess the performance and efficiency of each tool, including their capabilities, speed, and cost.
        - Identify any redundancies, inefficiencies, or bottlenecks in the current technology stack.
    2.Define technology requirements:
        - Identify the business intelligence needs of the organization, including data storage, analysis, reporting, and visualization.
        - Determine the key requirements for each of these areas, including data sources, processing power, storage capacity, and reporting capabilities.
        - Prioritize the requirements based on their impact on business objectives and their cost.
    3.Develop a technology roadmap:
        - Based on the identified technology requirements, develop a roadmap for the technology stack that outlines the necessary steps to achieve a more lean and efficient stack.
        - Set clear objectives and timelines for each step in the roadmap.
        - Identify the resources needed, including budget, personnel, and technology tools.
    4.Implement a cloud-based infrastructure:
        - Cloud-based infrastructure provides the flexibility to scale up or down, depending on the organization's needs.
        - It also provides cost savings through lower infrastructure costs, such as hardware and maintenance expenses.
        - Choose a cloud provider that offers robust security features, such as encryption and backup services.
    5.Adopt open-source technologies:
        - Open-source technologies are cost-effective, flexible, and customizable.
        - They allow the organization to leverage community-driven solutions, which often have a faster development cycle than proprietary technologies.
        - Identify the key open-source technologies that meet the business intelligence needs of the organization, such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and PostgreSQL.
    6.Automate data processing:
        - Automating data processing can save time and reduce errors in data analysis.
        - Identify the areas where automation can be most effective, such as data ingestion, data cleaning, and data transformation.
        - Use tools such as Apache Airflow, Apache NiFi, or Talend to automate these processes.
    7.Leverage machine learning and AI:
        - Machine learning and AI can provide more accurate and faster insights, as well as identify patterns that might be missed by humans.
        - Identify the areas where machine learning and AI can have the greatest impact, such as predictive analytics or natural language processing.
        - Use tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn to implement machine learning and AI models.
    8.Monitor and optimize the technology stack:
        - Regularly monitor the performance of the technology stack to ensure that it is meeting the organization's needs.
        - Use metrics to track performance and identify areas where improvements can be made.
        - Continuously evaluate the technology stack and adjust it as needed to meet the changing needs of the organization.

Overall, to plan and meet the best practices to achieve a more lean and efficient technology stack, it's important to evaluate the existing technology stack, define technology requirements, develop a technology roadmap, implement a cloud-based infrastructure, adopt open-source technologies, automate data processing, leverage machine learning and AI, and monitor and optimize the technology stack. By following these steps, you can establish a lean and efficient technology stack that supports the business intelligence needs of the organization.
