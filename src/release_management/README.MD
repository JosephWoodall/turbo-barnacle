5 steps to release managament
1. Release planning
The first step to launching software is to kick off planning with stakeholders in your development team. While there are several ways you can execute this step, common initiatives include running an initial meeting, writing a business case, and creating a work breakdown structure to outline project dependencies.

Release management process cycle
Each of these tasks will help you, the release manager, execute a system development lifecycle. In the planning phase, you should also connect with operations teams and leadership to get the software build approved and ready for development. 

Here’s a release management planning checklist to use when starting this process:

Connect with stakeholders: Create a project summary report and send out in advance for stakeholders to review prior to your initial meeting.

Run an initial project kickoff meeting: Outline key details about the project, including the objective and success metrics. 

Write a business case: Explain the value of the project and the impact it will have on your organization, along with long-term benefits. 

Create a work breakdown structure: Visualize your project by breaking down dependencies into small tasks that are easy to understand. 

Submit software for approval: Get approval from stakeholders and make project changes before your team gets started. 

Plan your release schedule: Map, assign, and track project tasks in order to keep the software release moving forward. 

Once you’ve completed this checklist, you’re ready for the next stage: building the software. 

2. Release building
Step two of a release process is the most time-intensive as team members actually begin developing the software. In this stage, tasks should be assigned to stakeholders, and project information should have already been communicated. 

Once the information is clear, team members can begin building the software while simultaneously testing and improving necessary features. It’s a good idea to begin tracking any potential risks or bugs within the production environment so you’re prepared for the testing phase. 

Here’s a release management building checklist to use when starting this process:

Assign tasks to stakeholders

Execute project dependencies

Document software risks using a risk register
Use teamwork to problem solve
Roll out new features within a production environment

Automate initial testing

While teamwork and testing are necessary while building the software, the real testing will begin during the next phase. 

3. Release testing
Perhaps even more important than building the software, the testing phase is incredibly important in order to make sure the software is running properly and ready for launch. 

It’s helpful to have team members help identify and resolve any bugs that arise, but it’s also important to begin user testing in this step. While this will depend on how complex your software release is, user testing is an opportunity for consumers to test your software, usually in exchange for some type of reward. 

You’ll also want to perform regression testing, which involves double-checking already approved functionality to verify it’s still working correctly. 

Here’s a release management testing checklist to use when starting this process:

Begin end user acceptance testing (UAT)

Resolve or mitigate software risks

Identify software bugs

Perform regression testing

With software, testing is a large part of any release plan and can be time-consuming if numerous changes are needed. 

4. Release preparing
In the preparation stage of a software release, your team will need to finish making necessary changes and optimizing the functionality within the staging environment. This ensures that every part of the software is working properly and ready to be pushed live. 

It’s a good idea to have a final quality assurance check, if not multiple, to ensure all functionality is working properly. This can be done by you and your team, though it’s helpful to get help from team members who aren’t involved as they’ll be able to see the software with fresh eyes.

Here’s a release management preparation checklist to use when starting this process:

Replicate each software scenario

Optimize software integrations

Solve software bugs

Final QA

Once you have given the software a final review and it’s been approved, you can begin deploying it in a live environment. 

5. Release deployment
The final stage of a software release involves the use of deployment management. This is the process of executing the initial software idea and involves moving the functionality to a live environment. 

In order to deploy the software release, more testing is required to ensure functionality is preserved in the live environment. Once that has been completed, it’s a good idea to continuously evaluate integrations and make necessary changes to improve functionality. 

Here’s a release management deployment checklist to use when starting this process:

Deploy in a live environment

Test in a live environment

Analyze key performance indicators (KPI)
Employ continuous integrations

It’s also a good idea to close project tasks once the software is live and any needed changes to integrations have been made.
